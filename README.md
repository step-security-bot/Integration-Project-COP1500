Welcome to my Integration Project! My name is Vivian Procacci, 
I'm a student at FGCU, and I made a program assessing your personality 
through the Myer Briggs personality index. 
You will take 16 questions to determine whether you or introverted or extroverted, intuitive or sensing, feeling or thinking, and judging or perceiving.
